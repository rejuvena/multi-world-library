# Multi-World[^1] Library

> "Dimensions, made easy." â€” [Subworld Library](https://github.com/jjohnsnaill/SubworldLibrary)

Multi-World Library is a [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_as_in_Freedom) alternative to the proprietary [Subworld Library](https://github.com/jjohnsnaill/SubworldLibrary), developed with performance, capability, and compatibility in mind.

Full Subworld Library compatibility is planned, ideally as a drag-and-drop replacement.

This project is pending, but ideally it will end up becoming a more-maintainable, non-2000-line-single-file, user's-rights-respecting modding API.

[^1]: Name pending.
